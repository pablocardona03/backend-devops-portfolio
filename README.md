# üöÄ Backend, DevOps, CI/CD, IoT & Cybersecurity Projects

Welcome! This repository is a collection of practical projects that showcase my skills in **backend development**, **DevOps practices**, **containerization**, **continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD)**, **IoT simulation**, and **basic cybersecurity analysis**.  

Each project is designed to demonstrate real-world applications using modern tools such as Flask, Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, and Linux-based environments. All code is containerized, tested, and well-documented.

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I'm Pablo C√©sar Cardona Rodr√≠guez, an Electronics and Telecommunications Engineer with a specialization in Cybersecurity. I'm passionate about building reliable backend systems, automating infrastructure, and learning advanced DevOps practices. This repository reflects my learning journey and serves as my technical portfolio.
